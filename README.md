## Installation

### Node.js and npm

Before installing the DoorMe Website, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Follow these steps to install Node.js and npm:

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version of Node.js for your operating system.

2. **Install Node.js:**
   - Follow the installation instructions provided by the Node.js website to install Node.js on your system.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following commands to verify that Node.js and npm are installed:
     ```sh
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
   - If you see version numbers printed for both commands, Node.js and npm are successfully installed.

### React and Dependencies

To set up the DoorMe Website locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Java-rice/doorme.git
    cd doorme
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - First, navigate to the project directory (`doorme`).
   - Run the following command to install React and other necessary packages:
     ```sh
     npm install react
     npm install react-dom
     ```
   - If you're starting a new React project from scratch, you can use `create-react-app` to scaffold the project and automatically install React. Run the following command:
     ```sh
     npx create-react-app doorme
     cd doorme
     ```
   - This will create a new React project in the `doorme` directory and automatically install React and its dependencies.
