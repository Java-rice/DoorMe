              <h1>Our Mission</h1>
              <p>
                Our mission is simple: to make dorm hunting as seamless and
                stress-free as possible. We aim to connect students with dorms
                that match their lifestyle, preferences, and budget, ensuring a
                smooth transition into their academic journey.
              </p>
              <h1>Our Story</h1>
              <p>
                DoorMe was founded by a group of former students who experienced
                firsthand the challenges of finding suitable dorm
                accommodations. Frustrated by the limited options, unclear
                information, and the overwhelming process, we decided to create
                a platform that simplifies dorm hunting for students everywhere.
